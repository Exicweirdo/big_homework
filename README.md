## Let's Begin
We reproduct the result in xxx.

wgan-gp is from previous work of Ishaan Gulrajani, et al.. Hans modified it to compatible with torh 1.10 and python3

structure and theory of wgan-div is from https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-01228-1_40
## model.py
Pytorch model of wgan-div, not including residual yet

DO NOT use batchnorm in Discriminator.
## eval.py
Evaluate the output of our model and render it into a gif of 10 frames.
## train_cifar10.py
Our trainer for the cifar10 dataset.
## tran_lsun.ipynb
